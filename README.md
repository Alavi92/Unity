# Game Description
I developed three games. One was 2D and the others were 3D. My main focus was not on the appearance, but on the features that I used. The player, which in this game is a sphere, moves to the left, right (also front and back in one game), by using arrow keys, and also jumps. You can collect coins to gain a higher score. Each time you hit an obstacle, you lose score and when the score gets negative, you lose the game. 

#  Features
*   Different scenes including 2 levels, main menu, and game over menu
*   Score being displayed and getting updated on the screen throughout all the levels
*   Functional buttons for restarting the game or selecting the level
*   Camera follows the player with a constant angle
*   Traps and bombs
*   Change of the location or game over if caught in some of the traps
*   Object color change while being in touch with certain surfaces
*   variety of moving obstacles
*   some characters as enemies, which switch between guarding, chasing the player, or catching the player, in which the game ends(Using Finite State Machines)
*   Language boxes with buttons for interaction during the game
*   Hidden door that appear by jumping over a button. The door leads to a different scene
*   Crossing the river with a boat, which is otherwise untouchable
